                    <p>The door keepers explain in unison that one door leads to certain death, while the other leads further into the castle.</p>
                    <p>To help chose the correct door they recite a riddle...</p>

                    <p><i>Can you solve the riddle and choose which keeper is in front of the right door?</i></p>
